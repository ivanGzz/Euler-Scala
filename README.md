## Project Euler Scala

About [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

### Usage

If you have a standard Scala installation you should be able to run each solution with

    scala Problem<N>.scala

in the Terminal or the CMD.

Each program will only print its numeric solution.

### Disclaimer

I am using the problems from Project Euler to apply my new knowledge about the Scala programming language. The solutions
are correct but I don't ensure that they are optimal. Please use it only as learning resource.
